## **Class Projects**

## [MA 575: Linear Models - *Analyzing Spotify Music Popularity from 2010 to 2019*](https://github.com/christinaexyou/spotify-music-popularity.git)
* Analyzed data for top Spotify songs from 2010 and 2019 and determined which factors  have the most influence over the popularity of a song

## **Work Projects**

## Red Hat - *Using Open Source to Realize Sensor Failure Detection and Prediction*  
### [Edge Services](https://github.com/Enterprise-Neurosystem/edge-services)

* Demonstrated data storage for the Red Hat OpenShift Data Science (RHODS) workshop at the IEEE Design Methodologies workshop as many companies do so for historical purpsoses
* Created connection pooling methods for an AWS PostgreSQL database, mitigating the latency issue with normal database connections
* Created querying methods to execute and return queries on the anomaly table in the database which stores sensor data with anomalies


## Red Hat - *Best Practices for Creating Custom JupyterHub Notebook Images*
RHODS comes with curated JupyterHub Notebook Images as well as the option for customers to define their own custom images. However, the learning curve is steep as it requires wide breadth of knowledge in OpenShift and various Python packages. I experimented with three different methods and created documentation for them with the goal of lowering the learning curve:

### [1. Building on Your Laptop and Storing In an Image Registry](https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/Custom-Notebook-Images-Best-Practices)

###  2. Building on the OpenShift Cluster and Storing Only in Cluster (WIP)

###  3. Building on the OpenShift Cluster, Stored In an Image Registry with a Pipleline to Make Updates (WIP)
